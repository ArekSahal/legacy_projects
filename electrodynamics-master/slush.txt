The basic idea is to create a class

    Electric_field():

    """Takes in either an electric field, potential or charge_distribution. also the plane domain of the plane"""

    given one of those it wil calculate the rest and show them in a plot

    all of them will be stored in matricies

    E  will be two matricies Ex and Ey
